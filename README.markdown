Plink is short for Push Link, a bookmarklet that takes the current brower's tab's URL and pushes it up to the server.  Once a link has been stored, a second instance of the bookmarklet on another machine is used to pull the link down to the current browser.

Plink is a simple solution to a specialized problem in the Trifecta.com offices where some of us run multiple machines.  Most of us run chat, email, etc. on one machine and develop on another, this bookmarklet solves the problem of links ending up on one machine via chat/social media and having to retype them or otherwise resend them to the other.

A running version of Plink is available at http://plink.ericdelabar.com/.
